## Carlos Henrique Carvalho de Santana

I'm a software engineer, instructor and facilitator.

Postgraduate in Information Technology Management, I wrote an [article](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SV5MvFJ3q2fqAgOC_FNdvo_YnLoXWiEu/view?usp=sharing). As a software engineer, some of my work can be seen at [my portfolio](https://carlohcs.me/) or here.

I believe everyone should have a [personal mission](https://missaopessoal.com.br) - Try it! (in portuguese)

Maybe you can like to listen [my songs](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Kv6CaJSSTkaD9QHgjvrIn?si=caiXHl7gTIO8eckOU1lsMw) or see things that I [wrote](https://medium.com/@carlohcs) or following me to see some [guitar videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/carlohcs).
